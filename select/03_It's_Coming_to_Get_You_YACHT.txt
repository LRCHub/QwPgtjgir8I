I gave up one thing today
And that thing will be saved
I chose to walk away
So I can keep my brain

No I won't be your slave
No matter how much I'm paid
Your darkness will catch up with you
And you will not escape

No I don't want to fight
Because you're not worth my time
You can put up with only so much in this life

Steal all you see, leaving everyone to bleed
You're only nice when you want something
And we can see right through youy

It's coming to get you
It's coming to get you, get you
It's coming to get you

Etc...
