Sometimes I don't get you
It's like I understand
All I do is a waste
And the look on your face
?
And I'm feeling myself make it be
Together was one happily...
Sometimes I don't get you
?

Sometimes I don't know you
It's like we never met
And what seems fine by me
Is your littany of regrets
Am I'm clinging to something that's passed
That was never intended to last
Sometimes I don't know you
Lessons with my?

Sometimes I think I don't know
How to be on my own
Sometimes I won't answer the door
Or talk on the phone
With you by my side
I don't have to mind
?
So that it can continue to grow

?
So that it can continue to grow

Sometimes I don't get you
It's like I'm lost at sea
Then you say you're okay
And I know that you'll stay with me
Oh it never comes soon enough
We'll get through the difficult stuff
?
I'll be there for you
And maybe I'll get you
And you'll get me
