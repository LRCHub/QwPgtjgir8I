When no friends can't be found
And my girl is out of town
I come home to empty house
The telephone is all I have
When my plans don't work out
Mama says, don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
There's a club I can't get in
Every week it's the same damn thing
I get mad, I want to cry
It's my skin they don't like
When my plans don't work out
Mama says, don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Now my world don't look good
Not the way I know it should
And my time is running short
I didn't do all I ought
When my plans don't work out
Mama says, don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
When my plans don't work out
Mama says, don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
